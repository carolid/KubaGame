Python

# Description:
This Python program runs as a script and emulates a game called Kuba. The game's premise is to capture marbles. An visual representation and the list of rules can be found here: https://sites.google.com/site/boardandpieces/list-of-games/kuba

The program utilizes classes that represent the game itself, its players, and the moving pieces to enable two players to alternate turns until one player wins.
